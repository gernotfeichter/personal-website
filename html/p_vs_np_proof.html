<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    During my studies in Information Management I came across the P vs NP problem,
    which was introduced to us students by our professor in Informatics as being a
    major unsolved problem in the field. During the preparation for one of the
    exams I found out that a prize money of $1 million would be offered for a proper
    solution by the Clay Mathematics Institute, which caught my attention.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, I found the problem itself was quite easy to be understood and did
    not even require too much previous knowledge, which I did not already possess.
    As I had always enjoyed thinking
    about various issues of logical nature this was definitely an issue I was
    willing to spend some effort on. Being convinced I had always been quite talented
    in truly understanding things gave me the confidence I could eventually
    solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
    Being unaware of how long it would take me to come up with a plausible resolution,
    I must have spent at least a year of total spare time thinking about the
    problem, distributed over a longer period of time. Initially, I thought that it
    would only require me to have a certain
    amount of shrewdness and that the time aspect would be negligible, which turned
    out to be far from reality. It took me a while to truly get to the core of
    the problem, learning from each previous failure and finally coming up with what
    I regard as the proof. Then I put the solution down on paper in a structured manner,
    making it as easy as possible for the reader to understand.

<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>
    So far I have sent the proof to three journals, only receiving rejections.
    This is the reason I decided to publish it on my private website.
    That being said, there is still hope that one day this proof will be accepted,
    see the comments on the rejections below.

    Comments to the Author<br>
    The paper claims to present a proof that P \ne NP by claiming a lower bound of 2^(n/2) for the subset sum
    problem.<br>
    However, the argument is, at best, missing many ideas to be a true lower bound proof.<br>
    <br>
    The paper spends a long time arguing that in order to determine a 'no' answer to subset sum one must guarantee that
    each of the 2^n possible subsets is either too large or too small and that in the worst case one can eliminate at
    most 2^(n/2) of these subsets.
    However, even if one can 'only' eliminate 2^(n/2) subsets from explicit consideration does not imply that one need
    to enumerate all remaining subsets to determine there is no solution.
    For example, in solving the minimum spanning tree problem, one needn't enumerate an exponential number of feasible
    solutions to prove that the solution you find is the best solution.

<p>
    If those flaws are only those listed below, please let me defend them.
    Otherwise it would be helpful to list the concrete concerns.
    Unfortunately by receiving rejection, the discussion seems to be over,
    so no further clarifications are possible or seem to be desired.

<p>
    Yes, this shows me that at least the final conclusion was comprehended, as this conclusion is not directly
    stated in that manner.

</blockquote>
<p>
    By just picking a single conclusion out of context it is easy to refute.
    That is why it is pointed out in the abstract that all sections in its entirety form the proof,
    which should clarify just that what was criticised.

    Algorithmica primarily publishes novel discrete algorithms that have mathematically proven strong performance
    guarantees and significant original mathematics that is directly related to the design and analysis of discrete
    algorithms. The strengths of your work lie outside of these scopes. For this reason, I am returning your manuscript

    Dear author,<br>
    <br>
    It is our policy that such a submission claiming to resolve the P versus NP problem (and or its related<br>
    big open problems) need to provide the explanation why the proposed technique can overcome several<br>
    proof theoretic barriers. For example, we can consider a relativized world where P = NP; such a world<br>
    has a combinatrial problem corresponding to the subset sum problem. That is, the problem corresponding<br>
    to the subset sum problem is indeed in P in such a relativized world. It is the author's responsibility<br>
    why the author's argument is still consistent with such a world. Unfortunately, I have not been able<br>
    to find such an explanation in this submission; therefore, I would like to report the rejection of<br>
    this submission to the editorial office.<br>
    <br>
    Sincerely,<br>

<h3>My comment</h3>

<p>
    Admittedly I was unaware of the existence of so called 'proof theoretic barriers' at the moment of submission.
    I might need to spend further time exploring those issues such that I can eventually
    address those in future.

    In case an educated reader is interested, he might also provide the 'missing links' in meantime.

    Not having investigated those special 'proof theoretic barriers' yet, my current logical understanding is that
    this proof already provides sufficient evidence that P &ne; NP.

<h1>Remarks</h1>

<p>Note that the proof as provided on this page is the same as it was submitted to the three journals listed above,
    apart from this version containing some improvements:
<ul>
    <li>minor spelling corrections</li>
    <li>
        formatting corrections: The rendered pdf file now includes some parts that were cut off in the original version
        when some formulas were too long and therefore reached out over the boarders of the pdf. However, given those
        formulas had very long names, it was obviously not too difficult to find out what the missing pieces were, at
        least none of the readers complained so far.
