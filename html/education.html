<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Many times in life I felt like I would have a certain talent for understanding things.
    What was difficult for others often seemed easy to me.
    On the contrary I found it very difficult, or at least unpleasant to the utmost degree, to learn things by heart.
    Information that was not related to something I knew or I was interested in seemed so hard to remember.
    To the current day I am unsure if this difficulty to learn by heart is an actual weakness or results out of me simply not liking it.
    Fortunately there are ways to partly circumvent such problems in educational systems and I have no problem admitting I used lookup tables for such "dull" information, although this increased the stress level during exams.
    Nevertheless, actually wasting lifetime in learning things, that I knew would be irrelevant for future life, was not an option.
</p>
<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
    As I attended the Austrian eduction system, I am using the Austrian words for the respective school types in the following paragraphs.
</p>
<h2>Volksschule Gröbming</h2>
<p>
    I learned summation already in kindergarten from my sister, who was already attending Volksschule at that time.
    After entering Volksschule and given the first exercise in adding numbers, I completed it quickly, while all of my classmates were unable to provide a single solution.
    The teacher replied: "Look at him, he has already finished!"
    No wonder I was able to complete the exercise, as I had already known summation before, but I think I would also have been able to complete the exercise If I did not.
    I recall learning summation only by a short verbal explanation from my sister.
    It was quite easy to comprehend because I was already able to count.
</p>
<p>
    When it came to learning the multiplication table I was quite upset because we were advised to learn everything by heart.
    However, I noticed that any multiplication could be broken down into multiple summations, which would not need to be learned but could be calculated.
    Nevertheless, the resulting effort of calculating several summations for one multiplication seemed too high and inefficient so I gave in to the common dogma that the charts needed to be learned.
    With great enthusiasm I noticed a pattern when studying multiplications by nine.
    I noticed that the result of any number of the small multiplication table multiplied by 9 can be obtained using the following method:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The left digit of the result is the number minus one.
    </li>
    <li>
        The right digit of the result is ten minus the number.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example: 9 x 8 = 72
    7 is 8 - 1
    2 is 10 - 8
    Put 7 before 2 = 72
</p>
<p>
    Inventing this method for myself, I could calculate rather than learn the multiplications of nines quickly.
    To the current day I am calculating the nine series this way.
    Later, I found out that the method was not unknown per se, it can be found on the web today.
</p>

<p>
    In Volksschule I continued education with great enthusiasm.
    Until one day, after I handed in just another voluntary extra task, that we were rewarded extra points for, the teacher rolled her eyes and groaned.
    This gesture marked a pivot point in my educational path.
    I learned that a too high performance might annoy people.
    In turn, I lowered my performance.
    Still receiving only A grades till several grades, I received the first B grade in the school certificate of the third grade if I am not mistaken.
    Initially a shock, I noticed that my parents were surprisingly not upset at all.
    In turn I continued to slightly lower the level of my grades by lowering the effort over time.
</p>
<h2>Hauptschule Gröbming</h2>
<p>
    In Hauptschule the level of my grades dropped to about average.
    Passing with minimum effort was my goal.
    I had lost all the motivation and was convinced that grades would have little impact on future life.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore I was degraded to the second power level in math because the teacher was obviously making severe mistakes in judging and calculation of the grades.
    Being too shy at that moment, I did not protest.
    Luckily, after high enough performance in the second power level, the mother of my friend protested successfully such that we both were permitted to attend the first power level again.
</p>
<h2>Bundeshandelsakademie Liezen</h2>
<p>
    After Hauptschule one roughly has the choice to learn a profession or to continue with higher education.
    Thinking that working was worse than attending school, I decided to remain in the educational system.
    Not finding interesting schools in the near of mine, I chose to attend a Handelsakademie which offered at least an IT branch that interested me.
    As expected, the IT branch was indeed very interesting to me, but we did not learn enough for me to be satisfied.
    The rest was not very appealing to me and that reflected in the grades.
    Nevertheless, for the final exam I was even awarded with "good success".
</p>
<h2>University FH Joanneum Graz</h2>
<p>
    After completion of the Handeslsakademie I initially wanted to get a job.
    Due to the fact that my applications were for whatever reason mostly unsuccessful, I applied at University for Information Management which reflected my passion.
    It needs to be said that I had a hard time convincing my parents that I would be able to successfully complete my studies as they were not convinced about my abilities.
    I could have done what I wanted at that age, but this is easier said than done with little money and no job.
    As my job applications failed, my parents finally agreed on my attempt to study at university.
    Finally, I could graduate as Bachelor of Science in Engineering with distinction.
</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
    As Bachelor of Science in Information Management I could gather enough IT skills to satisfy my personal goals.
    I gained enough knowledge for being able to further deepen my studies in any IT related area of my desire.
    Life long learning and constant change are paradigms that are especially applicable in the IT sector.
    So far I do not find that going for a Masters Degree would be either required or beneficial for me.
    I prefer deepening my knowledge to the areas of my interests instead of what an institution sets up.
    I find we all have limited resources and time should be invested carefully in life.
</p>
<h3>Fails</h3>
<p>
    In some exams I also got negative grades and such can quickly threaten the entire progress of the studies.
    I always focused with great effort in such cases and sometimes was even able to achieve A grades afterwards.
    Nevertheless, such negative news were always a big shock, until luckily everything was in control again.
</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p>
    In general, I did not enjoy the educational path.
    Getting up very early was especially painful to me as a night owl.
    Learning things that only others find interesting is not in my mind.
    In other words: Standardized educational systems do provide little room for individuality.
    I found learning unnecessary facts by heart is a tremendous waste of time that spans from the lowest to the highest forms of education.
    Having long holidays puts pressure on a student finding jobs frequently that are limited to short time and poor wage, a situation that can not be desired.
    Even subjects that are supposedly oriented towards understanding, like math, reward those more in exams that are able to execute predefined procedures faster more than those that have a deeper understanding of things. This might increase the chances of the majority of students to be able to pass the tests but is possibly not the initial goal. A monkey being taught to perform calculus operations of the same pattern quickly by practicing the same thing over and over again is not necessarily a good mathematician.
    The higher the educational system, the more work and stress, which does not necessarily mean an increase in knowledge and practical experience which seems to be the initial goal.
    Projects, presentations, dissertations and home works are often exaggerated to the degree that learning new things comes short.
</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p>
    Having short holidays here and there allowed for a lot of freedom and pursuit of personal interests.
    Standardized educational systems and standards in general have their distinct advantages as well.
    Learning something that one is particularly interested in can be a great joy.
    Getting a "good" job is facilitated with sufficient education.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    The educational system of Austria allows for major improvements according to my findings and I do not think that things will be much better in different parts of the world.
    No things in life come easy.
    Believe in your own perception, rather than what others believe about you.
    Be honest to yourself.
    Try to see the reality as realistic is possible.
    Follow your dream.
    Intelligence is a major positive contributor in all parts of life, but not everything.
    Willpower is also important, especially to overcome unavoidable traps.
