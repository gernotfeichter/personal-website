<h1>Oh my Zsh Plugins</h1>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a> is an awesome shell and I think it will largely replace bash, which is persumably the most used shell at the moment (2021). Broadly I would claim that zsh does not throw away the good parts of bash we are already used to but it rather extents the functionality. However, that zsh makes much sense, you will need a good configuration, here is where the project <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> comes into play.

    The plugins that I wrote for ohmyzsh are listed below.

    <strong>
        DISCLAIMER: At the moment those plugins were not yet reviewed nor accepted by the ohmyzsh team, so the plugins listed below are not available if you install the offical ohmyzsh. To use the plugins you could copy the plugins into $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/.
