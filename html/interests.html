This is not a complete list of my interests, just some selected ones that I think could be of
interest to the public.

<h1>Residential Renewable Energy</h1>

<p>
    Due to current events I thought a little bit about renewable energy and came to the conclusions
    listed below.
    This is not intended to be complete list of "all there is on the market", it is rather
    a compiled list of selected technologies that actually make sense for residential homes in terms
    of energy efficiency and cost efficiency according to my own research and conclusions.
</p>

<h2>Production</h2>

<p>
    Note: I decided to use the payback period as the most important indicator to compare energy
    production systems below.
</p>

<h3>Solar</h3>
<p>
    Solar Photovoltaic is a viable energy production technology and has a payback period of six to
    ten years [1].
</p>

<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>
    Things are little bit more complicated with wind energy, it seems to be more economical in the
    large scale [5] than in the small scale at the moment [4]. It is my hope that this could change
    in future, see the following section on Betz's law below, that I am currently evaluating.
</p>

<h4>Betz's law</h4>

<p>
    Graham Flowers posted a video on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXxIceWU6IQ&list=WL&index=4&ab_channel=grahamflowers">youtube [3]</a> in
    which he claims that his wind turbine is more efficient than what the conventional model of Betz allows
    (more than 59% efficiency).
    <br><br>
    I considered it worthwhile to evaluate the proposed solution!
    <br>
    <br><br>
    Claim: Wind turbine with corrugated foils with a diameter of 2.9 m produces 794 watts at a wind
    speed of 6.7 m/s.

<h5>Calculation of Betz's limit with standard air with 0% humid air at 0 °C</h5>

<p>
    Using what wolfram alpha considers "air", I obtained the following results:
    <br><br>
    How much volume of air passes through the turbine in one second? 44 m^3.

    <br><br>
    What could have gone wrong here? I think that the most likely reasons for my result being slightly off to Graham's
    is that we performed the calculations with different air temperature or humidity levels.
    For sake of simplicity I will therefore fix the temperature to a relatively cold value of 15 °C and repeat the rest
    of the procedure at 0 % and 100% humidity levels.

<h5>Calculation of Betz's limit with 100% humid air at 15 °C</h5>
<p>
    What is the mass of 44 m^3 air at 100% humidity and 15 °C? (1202 g * 44 m^3) = 52888 g

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>
    The importance of a storage arises from the fluctuating nature of wind and solar.
    Unfortunately, there are no cost-effective energy storage solutions available at the moment [2].
    Fortunately, there are many promising technologies on the rise, though too many to list.
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
    It is currently not financially viable to become self-sustaining by going 100% renewable, but it
    is possible from a technical perspective!
    The current best bet is to go solar and possibly combine it with a heat pump to partially live
    on renewables.
    Advancements in storage solutions are required, advancements in energy production solutions
    could furthermore enhance economic viability.
</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>
    It should be mentioned that I received very poor physics eduction and furthermore my chemistry
    lessons are more than a decade old, so I am in no way an expert in this field.
    Therefore, I need to be considered as hobbyist in this area.
