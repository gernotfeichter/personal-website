This is by far not a complete list of my interests, just some selected ones that I think could be of
interest to the public.

<h1>Residential Renewable Energy</h1>

<p>
    Due to current events I thought a little bit about renewable energy and came to the conclusions
    listed below.
    This is not intended to be complete list of "all there is on the market", it is rather
    a compiled list of selected technologies that actually make sense for residential homes in terms
    of energy efficiency and cost efficiency according to my own research and conclusions.
</p>

<h2>Production</h2>

<p>
    Note: I decided to use the payback period as the most important indicator to compare energy
    production systems below.
</p>

<h3>Solar</h3>
<p>
    Solar Photovoltaic is a viable energy production technology and has a payback period of six to
    ten years [1].
</p>

<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>
    Things are little bit more complicated with wind energy, it seems to be more economical in the
    large scale [5] than in the small scale at the moment [4]. It is my hope that this could change
    in future, see the following section on Betz's law below, that I am currently evaluating.
</p>

<h4>Betz's law</h4>

<p>
    Graham Flowers posted a video on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXxIceWU6IQ&list=WL&index=4&ab_channel=grahamflowers">youtube [3]</a> in
    which he claims that his wind turbine is more efficient than what the conventional model of Betz allows
    (more than 59% efficiency).
    <br><br>
    I considered it worthwhile to evaluate the proposed solution!
    <br><br>
    Long story short: I could not replicate this. The results are documented briefly in a very poor quality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY07mjvBNS0">youtube video</a>.
    <br><br>
</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>
    The importance of a storage arises from the fluctuating nature of wind and solar.
    Unfortunately, there are no cost-effective energy storage solutions available at the moment [2].
    Fortunately, there are many promising technologies on the rise, though too many to list.
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
    It is currently not financially viable to become self-sustaining by going 100% renewable, but it
    is possible from a technical perspective!
    The current best bet is to go solar and possibly combine it with a heat pump to partially live
    on renewables.
    Advancements in storage solutions are required, advancements in energy production solutions
    could furthermore enhance economic viability.
</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>
    It should be mentioned that I received very poor physics eduction and furthermore my chemistry
    lessons are more than a decade old, so I am in no way an expert in this field.
    Therefore, I need to be considered as hobbyist in this area.
